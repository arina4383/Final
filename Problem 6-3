You change your mind once more. You want to keep the behavior from Part 2, but now you would like:

>>> pe.say('the sky is blue')
Prof. eric says: I believe that eric says: the sky is blue 

>>> ae.say('the sky is blue')
Prof. eric says: It is obvious that I believe that eric says: the sky is blue 
Change the Professor class definition in order to achieve this.


class Professor(Lecturer): 
    def say(self, stuff):  
        return 'Prof. '+self.name + ' says: ' + Lecturer.lecture(self,stuff)
