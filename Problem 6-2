You change your mind, and now want the behavior as described in Part 1, except that you want:

>>> ae.say('the sky is blue')
eric says: It is obvious that I believe that eric says: the sky is blue

>>> ae.lecture('the sky is blue')
It is obvious that I believe that eric says: the sky is blue
Change the definition of ArrogantProfessor so that the behavior described above is achieved.

class ArrogantProfessor(Professor): 

    def say(self, stuff): 
        return self.name + ' says: '+'It is obvious that '+Professor.lecture(self, stuff)
    def lecture(self, stuff):         
        return 'It is obvious that ' + Professor.lecture(self, stuff)
